# Runs inside the container the Dockerfile beside this file builds, cwd
# at $SRC/base58-bech32 (the Dockerfile's WORKDIR).
#
# What the install takes is uv.lock's and not the index's.
# requirements.txt beside this file is the lock exported -- the package's
# runtime dependencies, of which it has none, and the `fuzz` dependency
# group's build backend, each with its hashes -- and the uv-export hook of
# .pre-commit-config.yaml rewrites it whenever uv.lock moves.
# --require-hashes refuses a file the lock does not name. The package
# itself follows with --no-deps and --no-build-isolation, which builds it
# with the backend just installed rather than one resolved off the index.
#
# Editable, because OpenSSF Scorecard's Pinned-Dependencies check reads a
# pip install as pinned only with --require-hashes, a wheel file, or `-e`
# and --no-deps (isUnpinnedPipInstall, ossf/scorecard's
# checks/raw/shell_download_validate.go), and pip refuses
# --require-hashes for a directory. The tree `-e` points at is the one
# the Dockerfile copied in, so pinned is what it is.
#
# The shape -- install, discover, compile -- is
# docs/build-integration/python_lang.md's own example build.sh for a
# Python project.
