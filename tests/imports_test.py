"""Tests for the import graph of the `base58_bech32` package.

Every module must be importable *first*, with no other module of this
package in sys.modules yet. Nothing else in the suite establishes that: a
test module reaches its subject through whatever the modules imported
before it have already pulled in, so a cycle that only bites the caller
who happens to arrive from the other side stays invisible.

What a module may import is the standard library and this package,
which is the whole of what `dependencies = []` in pyproject.toml
promises: each module is asked in an interpreter of its own at run time,
and each file's import statements are read statically, which is what a
module the suite never imports is checked by.
