"""A fuzz/corpus/ seed is still a string one of its entry points reads.

`fuzz/fuzz_<name>.py` and `fuzz/corpus/fuzz_<name>/` are read from disk;
neither is imported. Every harness imports atheris at module level,
which is CI-only and undeclared in `[dependency-groups]`, so this module
never runs `import fuzz.fuzz_<name>` and never executes a harness's own
code -- it parses the source with `ast` and resolves what a harness
*names* against the installed package instead.

`ENTRY_POINTS`, a module-level tuple of `"module:name"` string literals,
is what each harness names, and `fuzz_target`'s own body has to call
each of them and each decoder `tests/fuzz_test.py` lists. Every seed is
then tried against every entry point, and passes if at least one reads it
without raising `Base58Bech32Exception`.

What this gate is for is keeping the fuzzer's own starting point honest
as the decoders move under it. A crash the fuzzer finds is a test of the
ordinary suite, naming the input and what the decoder now does with it,
and never a seed: this gate would refuse a crash input added here.
